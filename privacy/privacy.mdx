### What is Privacy Mode? 

With `Privacy Mode`, none of your code will ever be stored by us or any third-party (except for OpenAI which persists the prompts we send to them for 30 days for trust and safety, unless you're on the business plan). Otherwise, we may save prompts / collect telemetry data to improve Cursor. 

You can enable `Privacy Mode` under `Cursor Settings` > `General` > `Privacy Mode`.

### Are requests always routed through the Cursor backend? 

Yes! Even if you use your API key, your requests will still go through our backend! That's where we do our final prompt building.

### Does indexing the codebase require storing code? 

It does not! If you choose to index your codebase, Cursor will upload your codebase in small chunks to our server to compute embeddings, but all plaintext code ceases to exist after the life of the request. 

The embeddings and metadata about your codebase (hashes, file names) are stored in our database, but none of your code is.
