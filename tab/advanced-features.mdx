### Tab in Peek

You can also use Cursor Tab in the "Go to Definition" or "Go to Type Definition" peek views. This is useful, for example, when adding a new argument to a function call.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/cpp/cpp-in-peek.png"/>
</Frame>

We especially enjoy using this in vim in conjunction with `gd` to, for example, modify a function definition, then fix all of its usages in one go.

### <div className="flex items-center" style={{ gap: '6px' }}>  <span className="cursor-pointer my-0">Cursor Prediction</span></div>

Cursor can also predict where you will go to after an accepted edit.
If available, you will be able to press tab to go to the next location, allowing you to tab-tab-tab through edits.

<Frame caption="Cursor predicted the next location, and suggested an edit there.">
<img src="/images/cpp/cp.png" />
</Frame>

### <div className="flex items-center" style={{ gap: '6px' }}>  <span className="cursor-pointer my-0">Partial Accepts</span></div>

You can accept the next word of a suggestion by pressing `Ctrl/⌘` and the right arrow (or by setting `editor.action.inlineSuggest.acceptNextWord` to your preferred keybinding).

To enable partial accepts, navigate to `Cursor Settings` > `Features` > `Cursor Tab`.
