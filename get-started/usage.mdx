### Premium models

GPT-4, GPT-4o, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet are all counted as `premium` models.

### Pro Trial

All new users receive a 14-day Pro trial, granting access to all Pro features. After the 14-day period, users who have not upgraded will revert to the Hobby plan.

### Fast and Slow Requests

By default, Cursor servers try to give all users fast `premium` model requests. However, during peak periods, 
users who run out of fast `premium` credits will be moved to a slow pool, which essentially is a queue of users waiting for 
a fast `premium` request to become available. 

This queue is fair, and Cursor will do everything possible to keep the queue as short as possible. 
However, if you need more fast `premium` credits and don't want to wait, you can add more requests on the [settings page](https://cursor.com/settings).

### Check Your Usage

You can check your usage on the [Cursor Settings](https://cursor.com/settings) page. You can reach this page inside the Cursor application as well, 
under `Cursor Settings` > `General` > `Account`, and press "Manage Subscription" for pro users, or "Manage" for business users.

Cursor usage resets monthly, based on your subscription start date.

### Optional Usage-based Pricing

You may opt in to usage-based pricing for requests that go beyond what is included in your plan by visiting your [settings page](https://cursor.com/settings).

Usage-based pricing details:
- Usage-based pricing is per calendar month (not necessarily same as your billing cycle, will be billed roughly on the 2nd-3rd day of the month)
- If you immediately cancel a request or if it errors we do not count it
- You can configure a hard limit, and you will never ever have to pay more than the hard limit per month (for the usage-based pricing)
- Right now, usage-based pricing only applies to Claude 3 Opus and a few models in long context chat.
