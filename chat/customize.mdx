### Choose an AI Model

Pick your preferred AI model through the [model toggle](/advanced/models#model-dropdown), and Cursor Chat will use that model to generate responses. You can toggle between models by pressing `Ctrl/⌘ /`. 

By default, Cursor Chat uses OpenAI's `GPT-4` for its AI model (specifically, the `gpt-4` label points to our instance of GPT4-Turbo).

The AI model you choose for Chat will be saved for future sessions, so you don't have to change it every time you open Cursor Chat.

### In-Editor

Cursor Chat can also be used as an editor tab by clicking on the horizontal "More" button, and then clicking on the "Open Chat in Editor" button.
Cursor Chat will then behave as a regular editor tab. Pressing `Ctrl/⌘ + L` will bring up the chat tab and focus onto it. 


### Settings

You can customize the Cursor Chat under `Cursor Settings` > `Features` > `Chat`.

These settings include:

- Always search the web for answers.
  - This will make the AI model browse the web each query for the most up-to-date information.
- Add chat fading animation.
  - This adds a smooth animation to the AI messages as they are generated.
- Default to no context.
  - This will make the AI model only use the user message as context, and no additional context such as current file will be included.
- Auto scroll chat.
  - This will automatically scroll the chat as the AI generates text when at the bottom of the thread.
- Narrow scrollbar in the chat pane.
- Show chat history when starting a new chat.
