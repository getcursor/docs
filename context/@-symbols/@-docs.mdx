Cursor comes with a set of third party docs crawled, indexed, and ready to be used as context. You can access them by using the `@Docs` symbol.

### Add Custom Docs

If you want to crawl and index custom docs that are not already provided, you can do so by `@Docs` > `Add new doc`. 
The following modal will appear after you've pasted in the URL of your desired doc:

</Frame>

Cursor will then index and learn the doc, and you will be able to use it as context like any other doc.

### Manage Custom Docs

Under `Cursor Settings` > `Features` > `Docs`, you will see the docs you have added.
You can edit, delete, or add new docs here.
