### `@Code`

To reference specific sections of code, you can use the `@Code` symbol.


### Code Preview

Similar to the [`@Files`](/context/@-symbols/@-files) symbol, Cursor will show a preview of the code's content so you can verify that the code you're referencing is the correct one.

### From the Editor

Another way to add code snippets as context is to select the code you want to reference, and click on either "Add to Chat" (`Ctrl/⌘ Shift L`) or "Add to Edit" (`Ctrl/⌘ Shift K`).

These will add the selected code snippet to either the Chat input box or the currently active Cmd K prompt bar.

To add a selected code to a new chat, you can press `Ctrl/⌘ L`.
