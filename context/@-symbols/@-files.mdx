### `@Files`

In AI input boxes such as in Cursor Chat and Cmd K, you can reference entire files by using `@Files`. 
Also, if you continue to type after `@`, you will see your file search results after the [`@Code`](/context/@-symbols/@-code) strategy.



In order to make sure the file you're referencing is the correct file, Cursor will show a preview of the file's path. This is especially useful when you have multiple files with the same name in different folders.

### Chat Long File References

In Cursor's Chat, if the contents of a file is too long, Cursor will chunk the file into smaller chunks and rerank them based on relevance to the query.

### Cmd K Chunking Strategy

For Cmd K, Cursor uses the file references differently based on the content length as well.

- auto
  - Automatically pick one of the three reading strategies based on the file size 
- full file
  - The entire file is used as context.
- outline
  - Cursor parses the outline of the file and uses the information as context.
- chunks
  - Cursor chunks the file into smaller chunks and picks the most relevant one.

### Drag and Drop

You can drag and drop files from the primary sidebar into Chat or Cmd K to add them as context as well.
