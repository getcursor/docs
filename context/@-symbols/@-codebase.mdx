### `@Codebase`

Through `@Codebase`, Cursor Chat goes through these steps until it finds the most important pieces of code to use.

- Gathering: scanning through your codebase for important files / code chunks
- Reranking: reordering the context items based on relevancy to the query
- Reasoning: thinking through a plan of using the context 
- Generating: coming up with a response

Another way of submitting an advanced codebase query is to click on the dropdown next to the `Ctrl/⌘ + Enter` button and select `reranker` for the search behavior.
This is only available when `@Codebase` isn't used, otherwise `@Codebase` takes precedence.
