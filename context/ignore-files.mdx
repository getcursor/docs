title: Ignore Files
---

To ignore files to be included in Cursor features such as [codebase indexing](/context/codebase-indexing), you 
can use a `.cursorignore` file in the root of your project. It works the same way as `.gitignore` works for git.

`.cursorignore` respects `.gitignore`. If you already have `.gitignore`, the files will be ignored by default.
If you want to ignore additional files, you can add them to the `.cursorignore` file.

### An Example `.cursorignore` file

```
# Ignore all files in the `dist` directory
dist/

# Ignore all `.log` files
*.log

# Ignore specific file `config.json`
config.json
```
