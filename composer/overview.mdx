`Cmd` + `I` (Mac) or `Ctrl` + `I` (Windows/Linux), aka `Composer`, is Cursor's solution for multi-file creation and editing.  

It has recently come out of beta.

More documentation will be added to this space soon.  

To use Composer, enter a prompt such as:

> Create a simple fun HTML website with an index.html file and CSS and JS folders and playful colors and JavaScript functionality

and watch it generate the files for you.  

Refactor across files through subsequent natural language prompts and either accept all suggested changes at once, or approve at the file or individual diff level.
