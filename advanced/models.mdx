With Cursor Chat, Ctrl/⌘ K, and Terminal Ctrl/⌘ K, you can easily switch between different models of your choice.


### Model Dropdown

Underneath the AI input box, you will see a dropdown that allows you to select the model you want to use. By default, Cursor has these models ready to use:

- [`GPT-4o`](https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/)
- [`GPT-4`](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4/)
- [`Claude 3.5 Sonnet`](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet)
- `cursor-small`
  - `cursor-small` is Cursor's custom model that isn't as smart as `GPT-4`, but is faster and users have unlimited access to it.

You can add additional models under `Cursor Settings` > `Models` > `Model Names`.

### Long Context Only Models

In long context chat, the model selection is limited to the models that support long context:

- [`gpt-4o-128k`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models)
- [`gemini-1.5-flash-500k`](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/flash/)
- [`claude-3-haiku-200k`](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family)
- [`claude-3-sonnet-200k`](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family)
- [`claude-3-5-sonnet-200k`](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet)


### What context window is used for model X?

In chat, we limit to around 20,000 tokens at the moment (or less if the model does not support that much context). For cmd-K, we limit to around 10,000 tokens, to balance TTFT and quality. Long-context chat uses the model's maximum context window.
